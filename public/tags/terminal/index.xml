Features Some of the features that make Fish more user-friendly include:
Syntax highlighting: Fish automatically highlights different parts of the command line to make it easier to read and understand. Autosuggestions: As you type a command, Fish will suggest possible completions based on your history and the contents of your directories.</description></item><item><title>My terminal setup</title><link>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/my_terminal_setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/my_terminal_setup/</guid><description>Having an efficient and tailored terminal setup is almost as important as your IDE or code editor in my opinion. Lets face it, whether your a Software Engineer, working DevOps or any other role within IT, chances are pretty good you will be spending a lot of your time working inside a terminal window.
It also does not hurt if your terminal looks great when you boasting your terminal skills to your colleagues at work.</description></item></channel></rss>
