      <description>Fish (short for Friendly Interactive Shell) is a Unix shell that aims to be more interactive and user-friendly than other shells such as the Bourne Shell (sh) or the Bourne Again Shell (bash).
Features Some of the features that make Fish more user-friendly include:
Syntax highlighting: Fish automatically highlights different parts of the command line to make it easier to read and understand. Autosuggestions: As you type a command, Fish will suggest possible completions based on your history and the contents of your directories.</description>

      <description>From installing different Python versions, creating virtual environments, installing different libraries and dependencies and creating configuration files for your project. I have been through this journey a few times, tried multiple approaches and tools, none which really worked or which I liked. During 2021, I was listening to a podcast episode where the hosts were covering a tool called Poetry. Some of you might have heard about Poetry before or even use it already, regardless I will share with you my experience using Poetry in managing Python projects and how it has made my life so much simpler.</description>

      <description>Having an efficient and tailored terminal setup is almost as important as your IDE or code editor in my opinion. Lets face it, whether your a Software Engineer, working DevOps or any other role within IT, chances are pretty good you will be spending a lot of your time working inside a terminal window.
It also does not hurt if your terminal looks great when you boasting your terminal skills to your colleagues at work.</description>

      <description>Introduction to RBO For many years now I have been trying to start my own blog. I just never got around to it. My go to excuse to myself was: &amp;ldquo;I just don&amp;rsquo;t have time. I am too busy juggling family, work and life.&amp;rdquo; The truth is, there is time, you just have to make some time available and cut some time out of other unimportant areas in your life, whilst keeping a balance of course.</description>

      <description>History Blüdhaven was a former whaling town, which was officially incorporated as a &amp;ldquo;Commonwealth&amp;rdquo; in 1912. The town had a generally poor socio-economic populace, owing in part to failed efforts to transform itself into a manufacturing and shipping center.</description>
