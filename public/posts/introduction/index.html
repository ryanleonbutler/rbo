I just never got around to it. My go to excuse to myself was: &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t have time. I am too busy juggling family, work and life.&rdquo; The truth is, there is time, you just have to make some time available and cut some time out of other unimportant areas in your life, whilst keeping a balance of course.</p><p>When trying to find half an hour to an hour a day, a few days a week, to deploy the blog and write these posts, I actually noticed I have more time available than I initially thought. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love taking a break and just vegging it out on the couch with a good movie, series or sport. In the end, when I counted all of those hours over the course of a few months and a year, it was pretty scary how much time I spent in front of the television or wasting time on other non-essential activities.</p><p>I also found it ironic how the more &ldquo;busy&rdquo; I have become over the years, the more time I actually have, whereas when I watched a lot of TV or played computer games it felt like I had no time at all. I even now have a family with two kids, but yet here I am starting my blog after years of being a bachelor.</p><p>Secondly, don&rsquo;t procrastinate or day dream about it, just go sit in front of your computer and do it. I used to tell myself: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it tomorrow&rdquo;, but that never happened. There is no time like the present and if you are like me and you want to start a blog or a website, just go and do it now (obviously after reading the rest of my post first).</p><p>Anyways enough about time and procrastination and getting back to the blog, I wanted to always write about technical topics. I have recently been writing some technical articles at work and posting them on the internal Wiki&rsquo;s. I really enjoyed it.</p><p>I specifically wanted to write about Python software development, the Python eco-system and packages as well as the Python community. I love Python, if it was not already obvious enough. I can&rsquo;t thank <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum>Guido</a> and the <a href=https://www.python.org/psf/>PSF</a> enough for the language and community they created.</p><p>It was not the first programming language I learned, but it was the first one that stuck and where I actually used it for work and larger projects. I learned Delphi and Pascal at school, C++ at university and played around with Javascript, C# and Java, but none of them appealed to me the way Python did.</p><p>I believe Python found its way into my mind, heart and fingers:</p><ul><li><p>with its clean look (I prefer the whitespace of Python way more than the curly braces and over complicated syntax semantics of its peers);</p></li><li><p>the batteries included standard library and thousands of packages on <a href=https://pypi.org/>PyPi</a>;</p></li><li><p>and of course who can forget those peculiar yet practical and clever ideas contained in the <a href=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>Zen of Python</a>.</p></li></ul><p>So without further ado, here we go, my first post, well technically my second as this introduction was the first. Please do reach out to me on <a href=https://twitter.com/ryanleonbutler>Twitter</a> or <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanleonbutler/>LinkedIn</a> with your thoughts about my blog or if you just want to talk about Python.</p><p>Thank you for your time and support, really appreciate it.</p></p></div><div class=prev-next></div></div><aside class=post-toc><nav id=toc><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction-to-rbo>Introduction to RBO</a></li></ul></nav></nav></aside></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2023 RBO</span>
