But which one ðŸ¤·
There is a lot of hype around Rust of late, and I have considered it for a while, but there is just something about Go that keeps pulling me back to it. That brings us here, where I will be learning Go, also known as Golang, and sharing my journey here.
Hold on tight, Go is fast, really fast!</description></item><item><title>My terminal setup 2.0</title><link>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/my_terminal_setup.2.0/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/my_terminal_setup.2.0/</guid><description>Previous post: My terminal setup
This is an update on my previous post showcasing my terminal setup and the tools I use. Since then I moved to Alacritty, still using fish shell with the Starship prompt. See below some basic steps to get started with each and links to my configuration files on GitHub.
Alacritty Alacritty is actually a very basic terminal. No tabs and no menus. And that&amp;rsquo;s what makes it great.</description></item><item><title>Moving to fish shell</title><link>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/moving_to_fish_shell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/moving_to_fish_shell/</guid><description>Fish (short for Friendly Interactive Shell) is a Unix shell that aims to be more interactive and user-friendly than other shells such as the Bourne Shell (sh) or the Bourne Again Shell (bash).
Features Some of the features that make Fish more user-friendly include:
Syntax highlighting: Fish automatically highlights different parts of the command line to make it easier to read and understand. Autosuggestions: As you type a command, Fish will suggest possible completions based on your history and the contents of your directories.</description></item><item><title>How to manage Python projects</title><link>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/how_to_manage_python_projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/how_to_manage_python_projects/</guid><description>From installing different Python versions, creating virtual environments, installing different libraries and dependencies and creating configuration files for your project. I have been through this journey a few times, tried multiple approaches and tools, none which really worked or which I liked. During 2021, I was listening to a podcast episode where the hosts were covering a tool called Poetry. Some of you might have heard about Poetry before or even use it already, regardless I will share with you my experience using Poetry in managing Python projects and how it has made my life so much simpler.</description></item><item><title>My terminal setup</title><link>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/my_terminal_setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/my_terminal_setup/</guid><description>Having an efficient and tailored terminal setup is almost as important as your IDE or code editor in my opinion. Lets face it, whether your a Software Engineer, working DevOps or any other role within IT, chances are pretty good you will be spending a lot of your time working inside a terminal window.
It also does not hurt if your terminal looks great when you boasting your terminal skills to your colleagues at work.</description></item><item><title>Init</title><link>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ryanbutler.online/posts/introduction/</guid><description>Introduction to RBO For many years now I have been trying to start my own blog.
