        RBO is a developer blog focussing on all things Python. From web frameworks like Django and Flask to popular and useful packages on PyPi.
        <br><br>
        You will also find how-to tutorials here on various topics, for example how I deployed this blog. I will also share major news stories surrounding Python and explain my thoughts on these stories.
        <br><br>
         Come join me on my journey where you and I will be learning more about my favourite programming language, Python.

        Thank you for your time and support.
