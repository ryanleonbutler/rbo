    details: "I am an Information Technology specialist with both a technical and management background in the field. I have been involved in major project roll outs and the implementation of various new technologies with a focus on Enterprise IT benefit realization, risk optimization and resource optimization. Concurrently, I have managed a software development division, which was responsible for the SDLC, installation, implementation, support and day to day operations of the division towards a large customer base. 
              More recently I have been employed by the largest Cloud computing services provider in the world, where I became a subject matter expert in Content Delivery Networks (CDN). From supporting customer infrastructure on the largest scale to mentoring and training new team members. 
              I have been in the IT and Cloud computing industry for a total of 10 years and I am pursuing my next challenge of being a web developer/software engineer. I am a hardworking, trustworthy, dedicated and a self-motivated individual. 
              I believe that my strengths and knowledge is an asset to any organisation."
